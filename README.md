# Permafrost-Landslide-Susceptibility-Mapping
A landslide susceptibility map was constructed by applying an optimized random forest (RF) model to Yukon Territory’s Klondike region. The pattern of the susceptibility map indicates a good model performance in matching the modeled areas of high active layer detachment (ALD) susceptibility with the spatial distribution of 438 recorded ALDs.
